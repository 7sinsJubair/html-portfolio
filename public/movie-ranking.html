<h2>Zodiac</h2>
   <h3></h3> <p>Depicts the investigation into the murders committed by the 1960s-70s serial killer of the same name. The man's notoriety did not come from an extraordinary modus operandi like his fictional peers John Doe ("Se7en") or Martin Vanger ("GWTDT"). It was his calculated use of the media and colorful name that made him a household name. Zodiac was the inspiration for the first "Dirty Harry" villain (Scorpio) but there is little resemblance between their actions. He was able to get his ciphers printed in several papers through (mostly) idle threats, becoming a Riddler-figure in the process</p>
   <h2>The Silence of the Lambs</h2>
   <p>The popularity of Jonathan Demme's movie is likely to last as long as there is a market for being scared. Like “Nosferatu,” “Psycho” and “Halloween,” it illustrates that the best thrillers don't age. Fear is a universal emotion and a timeless one. But “Silence of the Lambs” is not merely a thrill show. It is also about two of the most memorable characters in movie history, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, and their strange, strained relationship (“people will say we're in love,” Lecter cackles).</p>
   <h2>Road House</h2>
   <p>When “Road House” opens, Elwood Dalton (Gyllenhaal) has fallen from grace. We don’t know how, but we know he’s so famous and so physically imposing that he scares combatants (including Post Malone) out of a fight club ring before they even throw a punch. (And credit to Gyllenhaal and his physical trainers for making him entirely believable as a former UFC middleweight.) After a fight that gets canceled before it starts, Dalton is approached by a woman named Frankie (Jessica Williams), who owns a roadhouse in Glass Key, Florida that’s named, of course, Road House. Her establishment has been threatened by local, motorcycle-riding tough guys for weeks and she can barely stay open. She needs a bouncer. She needs Dalton.</p>
